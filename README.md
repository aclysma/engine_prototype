# engine_prototype

This is a prototype. It combines renderer_prototype and minimum.

## Status

This project runs (even on iOS!) but it is only public so that others can see more practical usage of minimum and the
renderer_prototype crates. It is mostly for the purpose of dogfooding those two crates.

The sponza scene is from the [Khronos Group GLTF Sample Model Repository](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models/tree/master/2.0/Sponza) 
and has it's own license. I imported it into blender, split some of the meshes
into distinct objects, added a couple lights, and re-exported it.
